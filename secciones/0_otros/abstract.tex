\begin{abstract}

In this final year dissertation we present the development of a web application that facilitates the collection of data from certain social networks to perform analysis of these networks in order to extract information that is present in the data obtained. 

The main tool to achieve this goal is to make use of Formal Concept Analysis or FCA, which is a mathematical theory that makes use of lattice theory and logic to discover knowledge from a dataset, this tool is able to find information in a similar way or even more efficient than other famous techniques such as Association Rules. 

Also, AFC will be used with other tools already known in data science in order to obtain as much information as possible from a dataset. \\

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Keywords:} Formal Concept Analysis, Social Network Analysis, Data Mining, R (Programming language)}
